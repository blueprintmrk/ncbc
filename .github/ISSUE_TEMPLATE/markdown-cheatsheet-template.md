Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.

How to apply GitHub’s unique Markdown extensions

What is Markdown?
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

Gists
Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
Files with the .md or .markdown extension
For more information, see “Writing on GitHub” in the GitHub Help.

# Structured documents

Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

### This is a third-tier heading

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.

Syntax guide
Here’s an overview of Markdown syntax that you can use anywhere on GitHub.com or in your own text files.

Headers
# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag
Emphasis
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_
Lists
Unordered
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
Ordered
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b

Blockquotes
As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.
Inline code
I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

GitHub Flavored Markdown
GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features, many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com.

Note that some features of GitHub Flavored Markdown are only available in the descriptions and comments of Issues and Pull Requests. These include @mentions as well as references to SHA-1 hashes, Issues, and Pull Requests. Task Lists are also available in Gist comments and in Gist Markdown files.

Syntax highlighting
Here’s an example of how you can use syntax highlighting with GitHub Flavored Markdown:

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
You can also simply indent your code by four spaces:

    function fancyAlert(arg) {
      if(arg) {
        $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
      }
    }
Here’s an example of Python code without syntax highlighting:

def foo():
    if not bar:
        return True
Task Lists
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
If you include a task list in the first comment of an Issue, you will get a handy progress indicator in your issue list. It also works in Pull Requests!

Tables
You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column
Would become:

First Header	Second Header
Content from cell 1	Content from cell 2
Content in the first column	Content in the second column
SHA references
Any reference to a commit’s SHA-1 hash will be automatically converted into a link to that commit on GitHub.

mojombo@16c999e8c71134401a78d4d46435517b2271d6ac
mojombo/github-flavored-markdown@16c999e8c71134401a78d4d46435517b2271d6ac
Issue references within a repository
Any number that refers to an Issue or Pull Request will be automatically converted into a link.

#1
mojombo#1
mojombo/github-flavored-markdown#1
Username @mentions
Typing an @ symbol, followed by a username, will notify that person to come and view the comment. This is called an “@mention”, because you’re mentioning the individual. You can also @mention teams within an organization.

Automatic linking for URLs
Any URL (like http://www.github.com/) will be automatically converted into a clickable link.

Strikethrough
Any word-wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.

Emoji
GitHub supports emoji!
